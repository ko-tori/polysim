- set up basic webpage
- fullscreen canvas and buttons on top for tools
- add update and render loop
- transform canvas for drawing, draw grid on canvas within window bounds with 1x1 cells
- listeners for window resize events, mouse up/down, move, etc.
- allow moving grid around
- allow selecting points in a row to draw polygon, clicking on the initial point closes the curve
- with collinearity/betweenness test, implement disallowing points that are:
	- previously used points on the polygon
	- lie on previous edges in the polygon
- implement basic winding number function from class
- flip coordinate plane so it's similar to the familiar positive coords are top right
- implement selecting polygons (must click on a point that is exactly on the polygon's path)
- implement deleting polygons (select then delete)
- implement winding number animations
- implement a couple ui improvements
- add intersection indicators to the winding number animation
- refactor winding animation parameters
- implement triangulation animation
- add clear button
- scroll wheel to change animation speed
- rectification done without bracket sliding (some bugs remain)
- lines no longer overlap after rectification
